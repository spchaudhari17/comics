                        <ul>
                            <li>Delivering educational content and age-appropriate experiences.</li>

                            <li>Allowing teachers to access and share educational resources.</li>
                            <li>Displaying contextual (non-personalized) advertisements through Google AdMob.</li>

                    <li><strong>Advertising & Google AdMob</strong>
                        <p>Our app uses Google AdMob to serve ads. To protect children’s privacy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All ads are set to non-personalized (based only on context, not behavior).</li>
                            <li>We use AdMob’s “tag for child-directed treatment” and “under age of consent” settings.
                            </li>
                            <li>No behavioral targeting, remarketing, or tracking is used.</li>
                            <li>Ads are automatically filtered to be age-appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Parents may choose a subscription plan to remove ads entirely.</li>
                        </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Overview</strong>
                        <p>Kridemy is a kid-friendly educational platform developed by Sham Insights LLC. It provides a
                            safe, creative, and interactive space for children — including those under 13 years of age —
                            to learn through story-based lessons, quizzes, and comics.</p>
                        <p>Teachers can generate, publish, and share educational materials while maintaining a safe and
                            compliant environment for children.</p>
                        <p>All features are compliant with Apple’s Kids Category Guidelines and COPPA. Ads shown are
                            contextual and non-personalized under Google AdMob’s Designed for Families program.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Ad Network and Policy Compliance</strong>
                        <p>We use Google AdMob as the only ad network. Under COPPA and Google’s Designed for Families:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All ads for users under 13 are non-personalized.</li>
                            <li>Ads are based purely on contextual relevance (not user data).</li>
                            <li>No violent, adult, gambling, or unsafe ads are allowed.</li>
                            <li>Developers monitor and block inappropriate ads via AdMob tools.</li>
                            <li>Personalized ads and tracking are permanently disabled.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>What “Contextual Ads” Mean in Kridemy</strong>
                        <p>Contextual ads are based only on the content being viewed — not on personal data.</p>
                        <p><em>Examples:</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Math lesson may show a math-related app or educational puzzle ad.</li>
                            <li>A Science topic may show a STEM-themed learning toy or video.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Kid-Friendly and Safe Ad Environment</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ads are labeled clearly (“Ad” or “Sponsored”).</li>
                            <li>Ads appear only between lessons or at bottom sections.</li>
                            <li>Ads never interrupt learning or gameplay.</li>
                            <li>External links are gated by Parental Gate checks.</li>
                            <li>No manipulative or unsafe ads are allowed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Data Collection and Storage Practices</strong>
                        <p>Kridemy stores minimal data required for gameplay progress:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Username and password (no personal details).</li>
                            <li>Gameplay metrics like quiz performance, rewards, etc.</li>
                            <li>All stored securely — no sharing with AdMob or third parties.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
